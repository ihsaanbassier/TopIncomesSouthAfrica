# TopIncomesSouthAfrica
Abstract:
We use tax data (which, unlike survey data, includes accurate data for the very rich) to investigate the patterns of income growth over the period 2003 to 2016. Despite South Africaâ€™s need for inclusive economic growth in the light of its extreme inequality, we find that the top 5% of incomes grew at about 5% per year compared to national income growth of 3.65% per year. This divergence is particularly striking in the post-recession period (where top incomes grew at about double the national growth rate) and appears to be partially driven by high growth in income from capital.
